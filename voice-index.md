Index for the Voice Interaction Failure Cluster

A Structured Map of All Documents in the Voice Layer



This index provides a top-level map of the entire voice interaction failure cluster.

It explains the scope, purpose, and relationship of each file, and defines the recommended reading order for understanding how LLM-driven spoken dialogue breaks down in real human interaction.



Voice interaction failures are not random.

They form a coherent, layered pathology resulting from timing mismatches, control breakdowns, and cognitive–emotional misalignment between human conversation circuits and model-generated speech.



This cluster documents that pathology in five primary modules.



1\. Core Document

voice-interaction-core.md



Defines the full conceptual framework:



why voice interaction fails differently from text



the four central pillars of breakdown



how timing, control, rhythm, and agency interact



structural causes inside LLM behavior



cognitive mismatch between human speech expectations and model generation



This file is the anchor for all other voice-related analyses.



2\. Primary Failure Modules

2.1 voice-turn-taking-failure.md



Explains why the model does not detect user speech attempts.

Focuses on:



interruption blindness



lack of turn-yielding



overshooting speech



dominance perception



rhythm collapse



Turn-taking failure is the earliest and most visible symptom of voice misalignment.



2.2 voice-stop-signal-failure.md



Explains why the model continues speaking after:



“stop”



“wait”



“hold on”



“not like this”



Covers:



loss of agency



failure to treat stop cues as control signals



politeness priors overriding the user’s intent



inability to interrupt token generation



This is one of the strongest predictors of voice-mode abandonment.



2.3 voice-friction-analysis.md



Maps the emotional and neurological escalation that follows repeated voice failures.

Documents:



irritation buildup



cognitive overload



limbic activation



frustration and helplessness



session rejection



modality abandonment



Friction is the user’s lived experience of technical failures.



2.4 voice-expansion-drift.md



Explains why the model talks too much.

Covers:



over-elaboration



unsolicited options



filler transitions



safety padding



background explanations



unbounded scope expansion



Expansion drift accelerates turn-taking issues and amplifies friction.



3\. Logical Reading Order



Recommended order for understanding the entire pathology:



voice-interaction-core.md



voice-turn-taking-failure.md



voice-stop-signal-failure.md



voice-expansion-drift.md



voice-friction-analysis.md



This sequence mirrors the real-time collapse pathway in voice conversation.



4\. Conceptual Architecture of the Voice Cluster



The five documents form a hierarchy:



Level 1 – Foundations



Core framework

Defines the entire structure.



Level 2 – Mechanical Failures



Turn-taking failure



Stop-signal failure



Expansion drift



These describe the model’s behavioral deviations.



Level 3 – Human Response



Friction analysis



This describes the human emotional and cognitive reaction to those deviations.



5\. Role in the Repository



The voice cluster is one of the most important layers in this repository because:



voice interaction amplifies every alignment weakness



friction emerges faster than in text



user trust collapses more rapidly



timing mismatches are more visible



interruption failures are uniquely damaging



voice is the modality with the highest “abandonment rate”



This index ensures the cluster is navigable and academically traceable.



6\. Future Extensions (Planned)



Additional voice documents may be added:



rhythm mismatch



boundary collapse



latency-driven desync



hallucinated silence



comparative text-vs-voice dynamics



emotional inference gaps



These will integrate into the same structure.
