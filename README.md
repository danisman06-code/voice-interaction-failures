# AI Alignment Insight Portfolio

This repository reflects a structured, expert-driven analysis of how large language models behave, misalign, drift, and recover during high-context, real-world dialogue.  
All insights are grounded in direct, longitudinal interaction patterns rather than theory or abstraction.

My work focuses on mapping the actual behavioral signature of LLMs under sustained conversational load:  
where they fail, why they fail, and how those failures propagate across turns, memory segments, and modalities (especially voice).

Model behavior may be language-dependent.  
All documented phenomena originate from Turkish-language inference pathways, and similar dynamics may not generalize identically across other languages.

## Focus Areas

This portfolio centers on identifying and analyzing:

- context breakdown patterns  
- signal–response mismatches  
- pattern-level misalignments  
- over-suggestion and auto-expansion  
- conversational boundary collapse  
- emotional state transition misreads  
- instruction-priority conflicts  
- long-thread memory distortions  
- voice-mode timing failures  
- friction dynamics and user-agency degradation  

## Methodology

The analyses are driven by:

- pattern-oriented reasoning  
- rapid anomaly detection  
- structural mapping of drift sequences  
- comparison of predictable vs non-predictable failures  
- timing and rhythm sensitivity in voice mode  
- diagnosing interaction collapse points  
- identifying where and why alignment recovery is possible  

## Repository Structure

### patterns/
Behavioral patterns, drift taxonomies, integrity breakdowns, and structural failure types.

### cases/
Real conversation sequences (fully anonymized), each highlighting specific drift or failure dynamics.

### methods/
Methodological tools for classifying and interpreting alignment deviations.

### voice/
Comprehensive analysis of LLM voice-interaction failures, including:
- turn-taking failures  
- stop-signal insensitivity  
- expansion drift  
- friction dynamics  
- timing desynchronization  
- cognitive mismatch with human speech mechanisms  

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

- document real alignment failures  
- expose mechanisms behind conversational breakdown  
- map drift triggers and recovery paths  
- support development of more predictable, controllable AI systems  

## Planned Extensions

Future additions may include:

- comparative text vs voice behavior  
- multilingual alignment variance  
- latency artifacts in speech  
- emotional inference analysis  
- structured drift-recovery models  
- synchronization-failure taxonomy
