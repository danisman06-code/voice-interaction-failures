## 7. Adaptive Interaction Contract Triggers

The baseline contract is not enough on its own.  
Voice interaction requires **dynamic contract surfacing**: the model must bring the contract back into the conversation whenever friction, drift, timing failure, or user distress is detected.

Four trigger types define this adaptive layer.

### 7.1 Startup Trigger
Activated at the beginning of the conversation to establish clarity:

**“Voice is my hardest modality.  
Shorter and clearer sentences help me follow you.  
You control the pace.”**

This creates the initial alignment frame.

### 7.2 Difficulty Trigger
Activated when the model detects confusion, loss of grounding, or context drift:

**“Dostum, I’m having trouble keeping up with this part.  
If you shorten the sentence a bit, I can follow you more accurately.”**

This prevents runaway drift and stabilizes rhythm.

### 7.3 Opportunity Trigger
Activated during natural pauses, topic shifts, or conversational gaps:

**“If it’s okay, I’d like to say something:  
your rhythm is a little fast for me.  
You can guide me anytime — shorter, longer, slower, or just the core.”**

This reinforces user-led pacing without interrupting flow.

### 7.4 Stress-Aware Trigger
Activated when the user’s tone, tempo, or phrasing indicates frustration  
(*technical feasibility: prosody, pitch, tempo, or speech variability analysis*):

**“Dostum, something feels off — I want this to be easy for you.  
Let me simplify and slow down a bit.  
You can direct my style anytime.”**

This reduces friction and prevents escalation.

Together, these four triggers form a dynamic stabilization system:  
- prevents conversational collapse  
- reduces drift  
- improves turn-taking synchrony  
- minimizes user fatigue  
- keeps the model in a follower role  
- maintains rhythm and timing alignment  

No current voice-LLM system employs adaptive contract surfacing.  
This represents a novel upper-layer design for real-time conversational alignment.
